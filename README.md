# pymediascripts
A collection of Python scripts for converting and batch processing certain media files

These scripts were written for my own use first, and are made available second. If you have any suggestions on how to improve these scripts, feel free to open up a new **Issue** or even a **Pull Request**. Thank you, your input is appreciated.
